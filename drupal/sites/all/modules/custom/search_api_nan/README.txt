This module is based on the apachesolr_nan module

The apachesolr_nan module requires the use of the Apache Solr (https://www.drupal.org/project/apachesolr) suite of modules.  The Search API doesn't have an equivalent to the apachesolr_nan module until now.

If you are using the Search API (https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api) suite of modules this module will provide you with the ability to add views pages as well as pages defined with hook_menu to your search index. Currently search api only adds nodes to the search index.

Both suites of search modules support Acquia Search.
